My Savvy Coders project will be a Vacation web Application intended to help manage small tasks while on vacation. My home page will provide as the initial navigation through the pages of this application. This application will also include three pages of utilities which the user can go to an any order of their choosing. The first of these three pages will be a Week calendar that displays days of the weeks and any scheduled events during the week. The second page includes two clocks, one with the userâ€™s home time zone and another of the time zone where the vacation is located. The third page will include two calculators the first a general basic calculator and the second a percentage calculator.
