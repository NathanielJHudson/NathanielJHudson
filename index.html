    <h3>About Utility Application</h3>
<h5>My Savvy Coders project will be a Utility Web Application intended to help manage small tasks for its userâ€™s. My home page will provide as the initial navigation through the pages of this application and will include three pages of utility options which the user can go to in any order of their choosing. The first of these three pages will be a calendar that displays days of a single month at a time with the option to view any calendar month between 2019 and 2030. The second pages features a clock with an alarm that makes a sound when set off. The third page will include two calculators the first a general basic calculator and the second a percentage calculator.</h5>  
<h3>Pages</h3>
<ul>
    <p>
      The first page featuring the calendar will display any calendar month between the years 2019 and 2030.
      While the calendar functionality happens with the use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS it also utilizes a couple dependencies 
      to keep everything functioning prop and looking nice.
    </p>
    <p>The second page will feature utilities centered around time manegment.
      Utilities include a clock that utilizes the machines (PC) local time and displays it for the user.
      The second is an alarm clock that requires a time and date and will play a melody for the user when time has expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third pages provides the user with mathmadical utilities.
      both calculators on this page were made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
      The first is a basic calculator made using,  inline script (for simplicity),
      and takes advange of the jQuery library via content deliv network
      The second calculator is a percentage calculator that requires an imput number and percentage 
      then outputs the math automatically for the user.
