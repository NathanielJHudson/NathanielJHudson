  <h3>About Utility Application</h3>
<h5>This Savvy Coders project is an Utility Web Application intended to help manage small tasks for its userâ€™s by providing basic everyday tools such as clocks and calculators. This Application is composed using HTML for structure, CSS styling and for functionality, JavaScript at its core with the assistance of a few dependencies in some circumstances.</h5>  
<h3>Pages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Calendar Utility features a calendar display with the ability to jump in between months January through December between the years 2019-2030. While the HTML structure of this page is simple, this calendar uses jQuery via CDN to retrieve correct day of each month of each year and is displayed for the user by utilizing JavaScript functions and is organized in grid form using Bootstrap.
    </li>
    <li>The Time Management Utility page will feature a clock that displays the time using the browsing machines (this PC) local time with an alarm that requires a time and date input and will play a melody once time has expired. The clocks HTML structure is extremely basic and is positioned using CSS. The Alarm Clock JavaScript uses the setInterval function to begin the time keeping process with an Alarm function to set a specific time.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Calculator Utility will provide the user with tools to deal with numbers and includes two types calculators inside of HTML forms and styled using CSS. One that utilizes inline functions that are baked into JavaScript already such as the eval function to solve basic math and another calculator that calls jQuery functions via CDN to solve percentage calculations.
    </li>
